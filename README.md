## Loan Default Prediction Project - Readme

### Introduction

This readme documents my project on predicting loan defaulters using Logistic Regression on credit risk data. It details the problem statement, learning objectives, dataset, methodology, results, and potential improvements.

### Usage

This project is intended for individuals interested in learning about credit scoring and implementing Logistic Regression for risk prediction. The code can be used as a starting point for further development and exploration.

### Documentation

* The complete code for this project is available in the associated Jupyter notebook.
* Additional documentation and resources on credit scoring and Logistic Regression can be found online.


### Problem Statement

The project addresses the challenge of predicting loan defaulters based on credit risk data. This information is crucial for lenders to assess potential applicant risk and make informed lending decisions.

### Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you will:

* Perform data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization.
* Implement Logistic Regression using manual code or sklearn libraries.
* Evaluate the model using appropriate performance metrics.
* Develop a credit scoring system based on the trained model.

### Dataset

The project utilizes the Give Me Some Credit dataset ([https://bigml.com/](https://bigml.com/)), which contains information on loan applicants and their past financial behavior. This includes features like age, income, debt-to-income ratio, and past delinquency history.

### Methodology

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
    * Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify any missing values or outliers.
    * Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
    * Calculate Weight of Evidence (WOE) and Information Value (IV) to select the most relevant features for the model.
    * Perform any necessary transformations or interactions between features.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    * Train a Logistic Regression model on the prepared data.
    * Evaluate the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
4. **Credit Scoring System Development:**
    * Develop a scoring system based on the trained model coefficients and WOE values.
    * Assign credit scores to new loan applicants based on their features.

### Results

The project achieved an accuracy of 94% in predicting loan defaulters using Logistic Regression. However, there is a class imbalance in the dataset, with significantly more positive (non-defaulters) than negative (defaulters) examples. This could lead to biases in the model's performance.

### Future Improvements

* Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling or weighting.
* Explore alternative modeling techniques like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
* Implement advanced feature engineering methods.
* Integrate the credit scoring system into a user-friendly application.
